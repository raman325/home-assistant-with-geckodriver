# home-assistant-with-geckodriver

~~This Docker image is a simple wrapper around the [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Docker image to install Geckodriver for use with the [USPS](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/usps/) component.~~

**USPS has changed their website to disallow bots and automated browsing. Because of that, the myusps Python package that the USPS component is based on is obsolete. This repo won't be useful until an alternate solution is found**
